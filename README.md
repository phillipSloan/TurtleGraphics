Final project for COMSM1201 - Programming in C

Initially coding a recursive decent parser, afterwards adapting it to make an interpreter to show the drawings via SDL.

ADTs/ was written by the lecturer, rest of the code was written by myself.

No student can use this work without my prior written consent.
